# Horse Collision Overhaul - Roadmap

Collisions should feel weighty and natural, and should lean on the game's own RPG systems
(Horsemanship, armor weight, native AI) rather than brute-force physics.

## Phase 1: Speed tiers and non-ragdoll reactions

Complete, shipped in 2.0.0.

- [x] Map horse speed to tiers. Three, not four: measured plateaus at roughly 3.0, 7.0 and
      10.8 m/s.
- [x] Play a native standing hit reaction at walking pace instead of a ragdoll. Delivered
      through `actor:StartInteractiveActionByName` against custom `AnimationControlled`
      FragTags added to the animation database.
- [x] Keep the vanilla collision bark, by posting the native `hitReaction` brain message.
- [x] Drain horse stamina at trot and gallop, and dismount the rider when it is spent.

Known gaps carried into later phases:

- [x] Female NPCs stagger too. `wh_female_fragmentids.xml` had no `AnimationControlled`
      fragment at all, so it is declared and the block added to their database.
- [x] Detection reach narrowed to a horse-shaped footprint, tuned from 103 logged impacts.
- [ ] The horse and a staggering NPC can still push against each other instead of clearing
      past. Setting the animation's collider mode to `Disabled` did not resolve it, and it
      matches vanilla behavior when riding head-on into someone. Revisit with Phase 2
      momentum, if at all.
- [ ] Carried items are dropped when an NPC is knocked down at trot or gallop. That is the
      physics ragdoll path, separate from the walk-tier stagger, and predates 2.0.0.
- [ ] The `ColliderMode="Disabled"` explanation recorded for the walk-tier carried-item drop
      needs re-testing. A woman kept her bucket during a session running the un-fixed
      animation data, which the recorded cause does not account for. `fix/carried-item-drop`
      is unmerged pending that.

## Development tooling

Complete, merged after 2.0.0. Not a gameplay phase, but it changes how every phase below
gets tested.

- [x] Deploy straight into `Mods\` without Vortex, with the game path resolved rather than
      hardcoded so a clone builds on any machine.
- [x] Hot reload the mod's Lua into a running game, no restart and no save reload.
- [x] Hot reload the Mannequin animation databases the same way. Needed the ADB files
      written loose *and* `mn_allowEditableDatabasesInPureGame`, which ships at 0.
- [x] Live telemetry over CryEngine's remote console, with backend chatter filtered out.
- [x] Read the mod's live state out of the running game, which settles questions that
      guessing does not.

See `docs/DEV_LOOP.md`.

## Phase 2: Mass, armor and momentum

Scale the high-speed reaction to what the target is actually made of.

- [ ] Read the target's equipped armor weight.
- [ ] Unarmored targets take proportionally heavier knockback.
- [ ] Heavily armored targets are moved less.
- [ ] Striking a heavy target strips the horse's momentum rather than only its stamina.
- [ ] Stamina cost scales against armor weight, so a knight costs far more than a peasant.

Prerequisite met: pak asset overrides now work, which Phase 2 needs for any table data.

## Phase 3: RPG integration

- [ ] Apply native blunt damage on high-speed impacts, with the injury system handling the
      consequences.
- [ ] Horsemanship level reduces stamina cost and the chance of being thrown.
- [ ] Horse barding increases impact force and reduces momentum loss.
- [ ] A braced polearm hit head-on acts as a wall: heavy stamina cost, near-certain dismount.

## Phase 4: AI reaction

- [ ] Riding through a packed group inflicts a morale shock, so lightly armored enemies
      break and flee using native AI.
- [ ] Bumping someone at walking pace annoys them; trampling triggers the crime system.

The `hitReaction` message the mod already sends is the hook for both, and vanilla
distinguishes light from normal collisions through the `KOLIZE_S_HRACEM` and
`KOLIZE_S_HRACEM_LEHKA` dialog metaroles.
